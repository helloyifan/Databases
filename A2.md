THe occurence of S in a subquery is called a correlation of S in the subquery

Correlation in a nested query is when a relation of the parents query is used in the subquery

A correlated subquery is one that is executed after the outer query is executed. So correlated subqueries take an approach opposite to that of noraml subqueries.


Correlated Subqueries differe from normal subqueries in that the nested SELECT statement refers back to the table in the first Select statement


A constraint is specified when a table is created or after the table is created. Constaints are used to specify rules for the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data, the action is then aborted by the constraint.

A trigger is a procedures that is automatically invoked by the DBMS in response to specified changes in the database.
Trigers are mostly used to maintain the integrity of the information on the database.

Display all the Classes offered by the Math Faculty

select pname from Parts P1 
where (select * from Parts P2

select pid from Catalog C1 
where cost is not null (select * from Catalog C2 where C2.cost > C1.cost)

3.3 Examples Sailors who have reserved all boats.
```
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE NOT EXISTS (( SELECT B.bid
FROM Boats B )
EXCEPT
(SELECT R. bid
FROM Reserves R
WHERE R.sid = S.sid ))

```

solution: Find the names of suppliers who have cataloged all parts.
```
SELECT S.sname
FROM Suppliers S
WHERE NOT EXISTS (( SELECT P.pid
FROM Parts B )
EXCEPT
(SELECT C.bid
FROM Catalog C
WHERE C.sid = S.sid ))
